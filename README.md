## üèóÔ∏è Step-by-Step Guidelines  

### üîé Check for Duplicates
```sql
SELECT ID, COUNT(*) 
FROM ecom_data
GROUP BY ID HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
### Shipment Mode Distribution
```sql
SELECT Mode_of_Shipment, COUNT(*) AS shipment_count 
FROM ecom_data 
GROUP BY Mode_of_Shipment;
```
### Warehouse Block Distribution
```sql
SELECT Warehouse_block, COUNT(*) AS shipment_count 
FROM ecom_data 
GROUP BY Warehouse_block;
```
### Delay Rate per Warehouse
```sql
SELECT Warehouse_block, AVG(1-Reached_on_Time_Y_N) AS Avg_delay_rate 
FROM ecom_data 
GROUP BY Warehouse_block;

```
### Average Product Cost by Importance
```sql
SELECT Product_importance, AVG(Cost_of_the_Product) AS average_product_cost 
FROM ecom_data 
GROUP BY Product_importance;
```
### Complaints vs Delivery
```sql
SELECT Customer_care_calls, AVG(Reached_on_Time_Y_N) AS average_time_Y_N 
FROM ecom_data 
GROUP BY Customer_care_calls;
```
### Discount vs Delay
```sql
SELECT Discount_offered, AVG(1-Reached_on_Time_Y_N) AS average_discount_offer 
FROM ecom_data 
GROUP BY Discount_offered;
```

### Customer Rating Distribution
```sql
SELECT Customer_rating, COUNT(*) AS rating  
FROM ecom_data 
GROUP BY Customer_rating 
ORDER BY Customer_rating ASC;
```
### Product Importance Distribution
```sql
SELECT Product_importance, COUNT(*) AS count_importance 
FROM ecom_data 
GROUP BY Product_importance 
ORDER BY Product_importance;
```

### Gender Distribution
```sql
SELECT Gender, COUNT(*) AS gender_distribution 
FROM ecom_data 
GROUP BY Gender 
ORDER BY gender_distribution DESC;
```

### On-Time vs Late Deliveries
```sql
SELECT Reached_on_Time_Y_N, COUNT(*) AS total 
FROM ecom_data 
GROUP BY Reached_on_Time_Y_N;
```

### Average Discount by Delivery Status
```sql
SELECT Reached_on_Time_Y_N, AVG(Discount_offered) AS average_discount 
FROM ecom_data 
GROUP BY Reached_on_Time_Y_N;
```

### Average Product Cost by Delivery Status
```sql
SELECT Reached_on_Time_Y_N, AVG(Cost_of_the_Product) AS average_product 
FROM ecom_data 
GROUP BY Reached_on_Time_Y_N;
```

### Shipment Mode with Most Delays
```sql
SELECT Mode_of_Shipment,
       ROUND(SUM(Reached_on_Time_Y_N)*100.0 /COUNT(*),1) AS shipment_delay_percentage
FROM ecom_data
GROUP BY Mode_of_Shipment
ORDER BY shipment_delay_percentage DESC;
```
### Correlation Between Discounts and Delays
```sql
SELECT Reached_on_Time_Y_N,
       AVG(Discount_offered) AS average_discount,
       AVG(Cost_of_the_Product) AS average_cost,
       AVG(Weight_in_gms) AS average_weight
FROM ecom_data
GROUP BY Reached_on_Time_Y_N;
```

### Cost vs Rating Analysis
```sql
SELECT Customer_rating, AVG(Cost_of_the_Product) 
FROM ecom_data 
GROUP BY Customer_rating 
ORDER BY Customer_rating;
```

### Delays by Shipment Mode
```sql
SELECT Mode_of_Shipment,
       COUNT(*) AS NoOfShipment,
       SUM(Reached_on_Time_Y_N) AS DelayedSum,
       ROUND(SUM(Reached_on_Time_Y_N)*100.0/COUNT(*),2) AS DelayedPercent
FROM ecom_data
GROUP BY Mode_of_Shipment
ORDER BY DelayedPercent DESC;
```

### Customer Care Calls vs Delays
```sql
SELECT Customer_care_calls,
       COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Reached_on_Time_Y_N=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Delays,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Reached_on_Time_Y_N=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100.0 /COUNT(*),2) AS DelaysPercent
FROM ecom_data
GROUP BY Customer_care_calls
ORDER BY Customer_care_calls;

```

### Prior Purchases Impact on Delivery
```sql
SELECT Prior_purchases,
       COUNT(*) AS totalPrior,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Reached_on_Time_Y_N=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS PriorPurchases,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Reached_on_Time_Y_N=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100.0/COUNT(*),2) AS PriorPurchasesPercent
FROM ecom_data
GROUP BY Prior_purchases
ORDER BY Prior_purchases;

```
### Shipment Mode & Product Importance Combined
```sql
SELECT Mode_of_Shipment,
       Product_importance,
       COUNT(*) AS TotalShipments,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Reached_on_Time_Y_N=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS totalDelayed,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Reached_on_Time_Y_N=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100.0/COUNT(*),2) AS totalDelayedPercent
FROM ecom_data
GROUP BY Mode_of_Shipment, Product_importance
ORDER BY totalDelayedPercent DESC;
```
